# Data types are divided into two groups:
    Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
    Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)

# Access Specifiers -
    Defines accessibility of a method i.e who can use the method
    There are 4 types of access specifiers in Java methods :
    1 -> Public : can be accessed through any
    class in
    any package .
    2 -> Private : can be accessed by methods only in the same class
    3 -> Protected : can be accessed by other classes in same package or other sub classes in different package by extending.
    4 -> Default : It can only be accessed by classes in same package and not inside other sub classes in different package by even by extending.
    If we do not mention anything , then Default access specifier
    is used by Java.

# Variable Arguments (Varargs) :
    Variable numberof inputs in the parameter.
    Only one variable argument can be present in the memod.
    It should be the last argument in the list.
    Used when we don't know the number of arguments

    public int sum(int a,int b, int ...variables);
    
# Java uses pointers like C++ but internally uses them:
    In Java:
        You don‚Äôt get access to memory addresses.
        Instead, Java gives you references, which are safe, opaque pointers managed by the JVM.
    Example:
        String name = "Alice";
        String another = name;
    Here, both name and another refer to the same object in memory ‚Äî like a pointer ‚Äî but:
        You can‚Äôt see the memory address.
        You can‚Äôt perform pointer arithmetic (e.g., another++ is illegal).
    A reference variable (like an object or array) is actually a pointer to an object in the heap, primitive types (like int, float) are not references, and are stored by value.
    Object variables are essentially handles to memory locations.
    Security is also compromised if pointers are used because the users can directly access memory with the help of pointers.
    The usage of pointers can make the procedure of garbage collection quite slow and erroneous

# why constructor do not have a return type
    1. They are not regular methods
        Constructors are special functions whose purpose is to initialize a new object. They're called automatically when you use the new keyword.
            MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Constructor is called here
    2. They don‚Äôt return anything ‚Äî they return the object being constructed (implicitly)
        Unlike regular methods, constructors don‚Äôt need a return value(int,string, even void) because Java automatically returns the new object.
            new MyClass(); // returns a MyClass object ‚Äî implicitly, without writing 'return'
        If constructors had return types, they‚Äôd behave like normal methods ‚Äî which would break the entire object creation mechanism.
    3. If you put a return type, it becomes a method, not a constructor
        class Test {
            Test() {
                System.out.println("Constructor");
            }

            void Test() { // ‚ö†Ô∏è Not a constructor ‚Äî this is a method!
                System.out.println("This is just a method");
            }
        }

# why constructor cannot be final static or abstract
    ‚ùå 1. Why can't a constructor be final?
        The final keyword means a method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
        But constructors are never inherited, and therefore cannot be overridden anyway, So marking a constructor as final would be pointless and meaningless.

    ‚ùå 2. Why can't a constructor be static?
        static means the method belongs to the class, not to an instance.

        But a constructor‚Äôs job is to create an instance.
            You can't create an instance (an object) from a static context, because the instance doesn't exist yet.
            If constructors were static, they would have no access to instance members, which defeats their purpose.

    ‚ùå 3. Why can't a constructor be abstract?
        abstract methods are meant to be overridden by subclasses.
        But constructors are not inherited, so they can‚Äôt be overridden.
            Also, you can‚Äôt instantiate abstract classes, and a constructor's main purpose is to enable instantiation.

# Constructor chaining using (this and super)
    Constructor chaining in Java means one constructor calls another constructor in the same class or in the superclass. It helps avoid code duplication and manage object initialization in a clean, organized way.

    üß± Two Types of Constructor Chaining:
        ‚úÖ 1. Within the same class ‚Äî using this(...)
            You use this() to call another constructor in the same class.
            class MyClass {
                MyClass() {
                    this(10);  // calls the parameterized constructor
                    System.out.println("No-arg constructor");
                }

                MyClass(int x) {
                    System.out.println("Parameterized constructor: " + x);
                }
            }
            Output:
                Parameterized constructor: 10  
                No-arg constructor

        ‚úÖ 2. From subclass to superclass ‚Äî using super(...)
            You use super() to call a constructor from the parent class.
            class Parent {
                Parent() {
                    System.out.println("Parent constructor");
                }
            }
            class Child extends Parent {
                Child() {
                    super(); // optional if Parent has a no-arg constructor
                    System.out.println("Child constructor");
                }
            }

            Output:
                Parent constructor  
                Child constructor
        
    üîí Rules of Constructor Chaining:
        this() and super() must be the first statement in a constructor.
        You cannot use both this() and super() in the same constructor.
        If you don‚Äôt explicitly call super(), the compiler adds super() by default, but if you want to call a parameterized constructor of parent you have to mention the super(int age,String name) in the very first line of your chil constructor.

    üß† Why Use Constructor Chaining?
        To reduce redundancy in constructor logic
        To ensure base class initialization is done before subclass construction
        To create a clear flow of object construction

# can we mark a class as private or protected in java?
    You can't declare top-level classes as private or protected in Java comes down to accessibility rules and how Java's compilation model works.
    Here's Why You Can't Do It:
        1. Top-Level Classes Must Be Accessible to the JVM
            Java compiles each top-level class into its own .class file. For the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to load and execute your program:
            It must be able to find and access the class.
            If a class were marked private, no code ‚Äî not even the JVM ‚Äî could access it, which would make the class useless.

        2. protected Only Makes Sense in Inheritance
            protected means accessible to subclasses and same-package classes.
            But top-level classes aren't inherited ‚Äî only their members (fields/methods) are.
            So protected on a top-level class has no meaningful interpretation.

        3. Java‚Äôs Design Philosophy: Simplicity and Predictability
            Restricting top-level classes to only public or package-private:
            Keeps visibility rules simple.
            Avoids confusion and potential abuse of encapsulation at the top level.

    But Why Do Nested Classes Allow This?
        class Outer {
                private class Inner {
                    // Used only inside Outer
                }
            }
        Because nested classes are part of another class‚Äôs scope, so the outer class can control how they are accessed:
        This is very useful for encapsulating helper classes that should never be used outside their parent.

# Diamond Problem
    Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity and complexity ‚Äî particularly the "Diamond Problem."
    Let's say in C++ you have 4 classes A,B,C and D:
        class A {
        void show() { cout << "A"; }
        }
        class B extends A {
            void show() { cout << "B"; }
        }
        class C extends A {
            void show() { cout << "C"; }
        }
        class D extends B, C { }  // Multiple inheritance!
    Now, what happens if you call show() from D? Does it use B‚Äôs version or C‚Äôs version? This creates ambiguity ‚Äî known as the diamond problem.
    Java‚Äôs Solution: Use Interfaces
    Java avoids this issue by:
        Allowing multiple interface inheritance ‚úÖ
        interface A {
            default void show() { System.out.println("A"); }
        }
        interface B {
            default void show() { System.out.println("B"); }
        }
        class C implements A, B {
            public void show() {
                A.super.show();  // You must choose which one
            }
        }

# Instance and Local variables
    Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost.
    Local variables are those variables present within a block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. The utilization of the variable is restricted to the block scope. Whenever a local variable is declared inside a method, the other class methods don‚Äôt have any knowledge about the local variable.

    Default value of variablea:
        In Java, variables have default values only when they are instance variables (fields of a class) or static variables.
        Local variables do not get default values ‚Äî you must initialize them before use otherwise you will get a compilation error.

    question -> 11

# Copy contructor, deep copy vs shallow copy
    In Java, a copy constructor is a special constructor used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.
    Unlike C++, Java does not provide a built-in copy constructor ‚Äî but you can easily define your own.
        
    If your class contains references to mutable objects (e.g., arrays, lists, other objects):
        Shallow copy just copies the reference ‚Üí both objects share the same internal object.
        Deep copy creates a full independent copy of the internal object(s).

        public Student(Student other) {
            this.name = other.name;
            this.marks = other.marks.clone();  // Deep copy of array
        }

    question 30

# Final keywords in java
    final variable:
        When a variable is declared as final in Java, the value can‚Äôt be modified once it has been assigned.
        If any value has not been assigned to that variable, then it can be assigned only by the constructor of the class.
    final method:
        A method declared as final cannot be overridden by its children's classes.
        A constructor cannot be marked as final because whenever a class is inherited, the constructors are not inherited. Hence, marking it final doesn't make sense. Java throws compilation error saying - modifier final not allowed here
    final class:
        No classes can be inherited from the class declared as final. But that final class can extend other classes for its usage.

# why the main method is static
    public class MyApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // program starts here
        }
    }
    When you run a Java program:
        The JVM loads the class (MyApp).
        Then it calls MyApp.main(args) without creating an object.
        Since main() is static, the JVM can call it directly using the class name.

    What if main() were not static?

    public void main(String[] args) {
        // Not static!
    }
    The JVM would need to do this:
        new MyApp().main(args);
        But to do that, it would need to instantiate MyApp first, which requires calling a constructor ‚Äî and maybe that constructor needs values, resources, etc.

    That leads to a chicken-and-egg problem: how can you run code if you must run other code first? So making main() static solves this problem.

# can static method be overloaded and overriden
    overloading
        Yes! There can be two or more static methods in a class with the same name but differing input parameters.
    overriding
        No! Declaration of static methods having the same signature can be done in the subclass but run time polymorphism can not take place in such cases.
        Overriding or dynamic polymorphism occurs during the runtime, but the static methods are loaded and looked up at the compile time statically, so static method declare in parent class is loaded to run from child class at compile time. Hence, these methods cant be overridden.

        You can declare a static method with the same signature in a subclass, but it's method hiding, not overriding. This is not method overriding ‚Äî it‚Äôs called method hiding.
            class Parent {
                static void show() {
                    System.out.println("Parent static show");
                }
            }

            class Child extends Parent {
                static void show() {
                    System.out.println("Child static show");
                }
            }

            public class Test {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Parent p = new Child();
                    p.show();  // Output: Parent static show
                }
            }
        Why is the output from Parent?
            Because static methods are resolved at compile time using the reference type, not the object type.
            p is declared as Parent, so Parent.show() is called ‚Äî even though the object is a Child.

# Why can't a static method access instance variables or instance methods directly?
    Consider this:
        public class MyClass {
            int x = 10;  // instance variable
            static int y = 10;

            static void printX() {
                System.out.println(y);  // works fine
                System.out.println(x);  // ‚ùå Compilation error
            }
        }
        printX() is static ‚Äî it runs without creating an object.
        x is an instance variable ‚Äî it lives inside an object.

        But in static context, there's no object, so Java says:
            Cannot make a static reference to the non-static field x
    Static variable and class gets memory where the class is loaded. And these can directly be called with the help of class names.

# static nested class
    A class in the java program cannot be static except if it is the inner class. If it is an inner static class, then it exactly works like other static members of the class, that's why we call it static nested class.
    Static nested classes do not depend on an instance of the outer class.
    You can use them without creating an outer class object.
    Therefore, they are shared just like static methods or variables ‚Äî they belong to the class, not the instances.

    Static variables and static methods:
        These are shared across all instances of a class. There's only one copy in memory for the entire class, not per object.
        class Example {
            static int count = 0; // Shared across all objects
            static void showCount() { ... }
        }
        Calling Example.count or Example.showCount() accesses the same static member regardless of how many objects you create.

    But what about static classes?
        In Java, only nested classes can be static. A top-level class cannot be static. So:
        static nested class means:
            It does not have a reference to the enclosing instance.
            It does not behave like a static variable or method ‚Äî it‚Äôs not shared.
            It‚Äôs just defined in a static context, meaning you don't need an outer object to instantiate it.

        Example:
            class Outer {
                static class StaticNested {
                    void display() {
                        System.out.println("Static nested class");
                    }
                }
            }
            public class Test {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Outer.StaticNested obj1 = new Outer.StaticNested();
                    Outer.StaticNested obj2 = new Outer.StaticNested();
                    // obj1 and obj2 are separate objects ‚Äî not shared
                }
            }
    ‚û°Ô∏è So:
        A static nested class is not "shared" like a static variable/method.
    It's just associated with the outer class, not its instance.

# strings immutable in Java
    The String Pool (also called the intern pool) is a special memory region in the Java heap where Java stores string literals.
    If you create a string using a string literal, Java checks if that exact string already exists in the pool:
    If yes, it reuses it (no new object).
    If not, it adds it to the pool.

    force pooling:
        You can force pooling using .intern():
            String s1 = new String("hello").intern();
            String s2 = "hello";
            System.out.println(s1 == s2);  // true ‚úÖ

        .intern() checks if "hello" is in the pool. If yes, returns pooled reference. If not, adds it and returns it.

    Note -> String str1 = new String("InterviewBit"), this will create a new object inside heap not inside the string pool;

    https://www.interviewbit.com/java-interview-questions/#static-methods-static-variables-and-static-classes-in-java
    intermediate question 1

    why are Stirng immutable in java:
        Thread-Safety
            Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe.
            Multiple threads can read the same String without synchronization.
        Hashcode Caching
            Strings are heavily used as keys in HashMaps and HashSets.
            Their immutability allows their hashcode to be cached at construction for performance.
        String Pooling (Interning)
            Java optimizes memory by reusing common literals in the String Pool.
            If strings were mutable, changing one pooled string would affect all references to it üò±
            Immutability ensures that pool values remain constant.

# What part of memory - Stack or Heap - is cleaned in garbage collection process?
    Garbage collection cleans the Heap, NOT the Stack.
    Heap Memory:
        Stores: Objects and class instances
        Managed by: Garbage Collector
        When an object has no more references, it becomes eligible for GC
        GC reclaims this memory to avoid memory leaks and OutOfMemoryErrors
     Stack Memory:
        Stores: method calls, local variables, and reference variables
        Managed: automatically via the call stack
        Freed when method execution completes ‚Äî no need for GC

# Java memory management
    Java works on two types of places to store memory that is stack and a heap, bot stack and heap are created by JVM and stored in RAM
    Stack Memory:
        Stack stores temporary variables & separate memory block for methods.
        Store primitive data types, they store the value and not referrence to a memory location.
        store reference of heap objects:
            Strong seference
            Weak reference
            Soft reference
        Each thread has its own stack, but all the thread operate on one single HEAP memory.
        memory:
            Variables within a scope is only visible and as soon as any variable goes out of the Score , it gets deleted from the Stack (in LF0 order)

        When stack memory goes full, it throws "java.lang.StackOverflowError"

    As we know now objects are created inside the heap and there referrences are stored in stack:
        Suppose i call a method helloMemory() where i initialize some primitive data types and some objects of a class
        They get created and their referrence is stored inside stack but their scope is limited to the method call.
        As the method execution gets done these referrence are also deleted from the memory
        But what about the actual objects that got created inside the heap? how will we delete those objects, here comes the garbage collector.
    
    Garbage collector
        Garbag collector removes the unreferrenced objects inside the heap memory, the execution of gc is automatically controlled by JVM, if heap memory is running out of space then JVM will run the gc more perodically.
        Garbage Collector runs periodically & JVM controls when to run the garbage collector .We can also tell the Jri to run the garbage collector using System.gc() but this doesn't guarantee that gc will run that is why all of this is automatic memory management.

        MyObject obj = new MyObject();  // object created
        obj = null;                     // eligible for GC now because no refereence of this is present in stack memory.

# strong, weak, soft and phantom referrences in java
    In Java, references to objects control how the Garbage Collector (GC) treats those objects. Java provides four types of references in the java.lang.ref package:
    1. Strong Reference (default)
        This is the normal reference you use all the time:

            MyObject obj = new MyObject();
        GC will never collect obj as long as it has a strong reference.
        This is the most common and safest reference type.
        Implication: 
            Use when you need to ensure the object stays in memory.

    2. Weak Reference
        Used for objects that can be garbage collected if no strong references exist.
            WeakReference<MyObject> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new MyObject());
        If the only reference to an object is weak, it will be collected during GC.
        Useful in caches or memory-sensitive situations.
        Implication: 
            Object may vanish at any GC cycle if only weakly reachable.

    3. Soft Reference
        Softer than weak, used for objects that should be kept in memory as long as possible, but can be collected under memory pressure.
            SoftReference<MyObject> softRef = new SoftReference<>(new MyObject());
        GC collects soft references only when memory is low.
        Ideal for implementing memory-sensitive caches.
        Implication: 
            Acts like a backup that disappears only if absolutely necessary.

    4. Phantom Reference (advanced)
        Used for post-mortem cleanup ‚Äî you can find out exactly when an object is collected.
            PhantomReference<MyObject> phantomRef = new PhantomReference<>(obj, referenceQueue);
        You cannot access the object via this reference.
        Must be used with a ReferenceQueue.
        Mostly used in resource management or low-level memory handling.

# Heap Memory Structure (in modern JVMs)
    Java heap is divided into generations to improve GC performance:
        1. Young Generation (Young Gen)
            Where new objects are created.
            Subdivided into:
                Eden Space
                Survivor Space (S0 & S1)
            Objects that survive several minor GCs are promoted to the Old Gen.

        2. Old Generation (Tenured Gen)
            Stores long-lived objects.
            Major GCs are more expensive and less frequent here.

        3. Metaspace (since Java 8)
            Stores class metadata (used to be "PermGen" in Java 7 and below).
            Grows automatically with memory demand.

    Object Lifecycle in Heap
        1. Object Creation
            Where Objects Are Created:
                Objects are created in the Young Generation (specifically the Eden space) when they are instantiated using the new keyword.
                    MyObject obj = new MyObject();
            What Happens During Object Creation:
                When new MyObject() is called, the JVM allocates memory for the object in the Eden space of the Young Generation.
                Local variables and method arguments are stored on the stack, while the object itself (its instance variables) is stored in the heap.

        2. Minor Garbage Collection (GC)
            What Is Minor GC?
                A Minor GC is triggered when the Young Generation (Eden and Survivor spaces) fills up.
                The GC reclaims memory in the Young Generation by removing objects that are no longer referenced.
                Surviving objects are moved from the Eden space to one of the Survivor spaces (S0 or S1).

            Phases of Minor GC:
                Mark Phase: The GC marks all live objects (those still referenced by active threads).
                Sweep Phase: The GC reclaims memory used by unreachable objects.
                Copy Phase: Surviving objects are copied from Eden to one of the Survivor spaces (S0 or S1).

            Object Survival in Young Generation:
                If an object survives a Minor GC, it is moved to a Survivor space (S0 or S1).
                The object may survive multiple Minor GCs, after which it will be promoted to the Old Generation.

        3. Object Promotion to Old Generation
            When Does Promotion Happen?
                Objects that have survived several Minor GCs are promoted to the Old Generation (Tenured Generation).
                Promotion to old generation means that this object is used frequently and might have multiple referrence in the current application, which makes it very important to survive and less chances of being of no use anytime sooner.

            Promotion Process:
                When an object is promoted to the Old Generation, it is no longer part of the Young Generation. It stays in the Old Gen, where objects are typically long-lived.
                Old Generation objects are cleaned up during a Major GC (or Full GC), this is a time taking process.

            Promotion Threshold:
                Objects that are large or have been around for a while (inside eden and s0, s1) are more likely to be promoted quickly.

        4. Major (Full) Garbage Collection (GC)
            What Is Major GC?
                A Major GC (Full GC) is a more expensive garbage collection process compared to Minor GC.
                It cleans up both the Young Generation and Old Generation.
                It happens less frequently than Minor GC but is more time-consuming and can cause longer pause times because it needs to traverse all objects in the heap.

            When Does Full GC Happen?
                When the Old Generation fills up and there isn‚Äôt enough space to allocate new objects.
                When memory pressure is high (when the JVM tries to reclaim memory).
                When system limits are reached (like max heap size or memory thresholds).

            Process of Major GC:
                Mark Phase: Mark all live objects (both in Young and Old generations).
                Sweep Phase: Reclaim memory from objects that are unreachable.
                Compact Phase: (Optional) Compact the Old Generation to reduce fragmentation.

# why do we have two sections young and old for memory management
    The Young Generation and Old Generation are parts of the heap memory in Java, and they are used to optimize the performance of the Garbage Collector (GC). The main reason for having these two sections in heap memory is to increase the efficiency of garbage collection by separating objects based on their lifespan. Let‚Äôs break down why these sections exist:
        1. Efficient Memory Management
            Young Generation is where most newly created objects live, while the Old Generation holds longer-lived objects.
            By separating the two, Java can optimize the garbage collection process based on the age and size of objects. This allows for faster collection of short-lived objects without the need to check older, long-lived objects frequently.

        2. Garbage Collection Frequency
            Young Generation:
                Minor Garbage Collection occurs more often in the Young Generation. The majority of objects are short-lived, meaning they become eligible for garbage collection quickly.
                New objects are allocated in the Eden Space, and if they survive the GC cycles, they are promoted to one of the Survivor spaces.
                Since these objects are mostly short-lived, frequent and fast collection is beneficial. Minor GCs are less expensive in terms of time because they deal with fewer objects in the Young Generation.

            Old Generation:
                Major Garbage Collection (or Full GC) happens less frequently. The Old Generation holds objects that have survived multiple Minor GCs, meaning they are long-lived.
                These objects are typically larger and less frequent, so they do not need to be checked as often. Major GC is more expensive in terms of time and resources because it needs to check through all objects in the Old Generation.
                By dividing the heap into these generations, Java can minimize the impact of GC pauses on long-running applications by collecting younger, short-lived objects quickly without affecting older, long-lived objects.

        3. Efficient Object Promotion
            As objects in the Young Generation survive multiple GC cycles, they are eventually promoted to the Old Generation.
            This process helps reduce the amount of GC time spent on objects that are more likely to stay alive for the duration of the program.
            By segregating the two generations, Java can use different garbage collection strategies for each:
            Young Generation uses minor GC to clean up quickly, as most objects are short-lived.
            Old Generation uses major GC to clean up long-lived objects, which requires more careful handling because they are more likely to be needed for the duration of the program.

        4. Heap Fragmentation
            If all objects were in a single space, frequent creation and deletion of short-lived objects could result in heap fragmentation, where memory becomes inefficiently allocated.
            By dividing the heap into Young and Old Generation, the JVM reduces the likelihood of fragmentation in the Old Generation, which is where long-lived objects reside. As objects are promoted to the Old Generation, they are less likely to be deallocated frequently.

        5. Optimized for Short-Lived Objects
            In most applications, a large majority of objects are created and discarded quickly. The Young Generation is optimized to handle this common case. By segregating these objects from the Old Generation, the JVM reduces the work done during each GC cycle.
            Minor GC cycles are much more frequent but faster, as they only focus on cleaning the Young Generation (which has mostly short-lived objects).

        6. Heap Space Allocation
            Young Generation is typically smaller compared to the Old Generation because it is optimized for new object allocations and frequent GCs.
            Old Generation is larger because objects that survive for a long time (after several GCs) are moved here. It is tuned for longevity, not for frequent allocation and deallocation.
# Singelton pattern in java, is it thread safe?

# can methods be defined inside an interface in java?
    In Java, methods defined in an interface cannot have a body (implementation) unless they are explicitly declared with:
        default
        static
        or private (since Java 9)
    
    interface MyInterface {
        default void doTask() {
            helper(); // calling private method
        }

        private void helper() {
            System.out.println("Helper method in interface");
        }

        public static void print(){
            System.out.println("static method in interface");

        }
    }

    ‚úÖ default Methods (Since Java 8)
        Allow interfaces to provide concrete implementation.
        Can be overridden by implementing classes.
        Use Case: 
            Backward compatibility. Add new behavior to interfaces without breaking old implementations.

    ‚úÖ static Methods (Since Java 8)
        Belong to the interface itself, not instances.
        Not inherited by implementing classes.

    ‚úÖ private Methods (Since Java 9)
        Help avoid duplication inside default or static methods.
        Cannot be called from outside the interface.

# can we mark interfaces and abstract classes as final?
    No, in Java, you cannot mark either interfaces or abstract classes as final.
    üîç Why?
        final means no subclassing or implementation allowed.
        abstract classes and interfaces are explicitly designed to be extended or implemented, respectively.
        Using final would directly contradict their intended use.

# Why is the character array preferred over string for storing confidential information?
    In Java, a string is basically immutable i.e. it cannot be modified. After its declaration, it continues to stay in the string pool as long as it is not removed in the form of garbage. In other words, a string resides in the heap section of the memory for an unregulated and unspecified time interval after string value processing is executed.

    As a result, vital information can be stolen for pursuing harmful activities by hackers if a memory dump is illegally accessed by them. Such risks can be eliminated by using mutable objects or structures like character arrays for storing any variable. After the work of the character array variable is done, the variable can be configured to blank at the same instant. Consequently, it helps in saving heap memory and also gives no chance to the hackers to extract vital data.

# Arrays.asList return immutable list, how can we add objects using Arrays.asList
    When you call:
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
    It returns an instance of a private static class inside java.util.Arrays, called Arrays$ArrayList.
    This class is not normal ArrayList class, but it does extend AbstractList and does not overrride the add and remove methods.
    This class implements List, but internally stores the passed array and overrides add() and remove() to throw UnsupportedOperationException.

    That‚Äôs why:
    ‚úÖ You can modify elements: list.set(0, "z") ‚Üí OK
    ‚ùå You cannot resize the list: list.add("d") ‚Üí Exception
    ArrayList How to make it resizable:
        Wrap it in an ArrayList:
            List<String> modifiableList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
            modifiableList.add("d"); // works fine

# Why Were Generics needed?
    -> Type Safety
        Before generics, collections could store any Object, and you had to cast manually.
            List list = new ArrayList();  // Pre-generics
            list.add("Hello");
            String s = (String) list.get(0);  // Must cast manually ‚úÖ
        If the wrong type was added, you'd get a runtime ClassCastException.

    -> Generics remove the need for explicit casting, reducing boilerplate and errors.

    -> You can write generic algorithms or data structures that work for any type.
        public class Pair<K, V> {
            private K key;
            private V value;
            // constructors, getters, setters
        }

        Pair<String, Integer> user = new Pair<>("Alice", 101);

    -> Errors are caught during compilation, not at runtime.

    -> Generics avoids the duplication of code 
        Suppose we have a box class that stores a single value(integer, float, boolean, string) now for creating a box object that conatins all these types but only one at a time i need to create 4 box classes.
        To avoid this generic helps us.
            public class Box<T> {

                private T value;

                public T getValue() {
                    return value;
                }

                public void setValue(T value) {
                    this.value = value;
                }
            }

# Bounded type parameters in generics
    we can also set our generic type to be bounded to a particaular type, suppose we want our class to be genric for numbers(int,float,long,double) but not for strings, we can simply make our class to be generic to Number class.
    code:
        public class NumberContainer<T extends Number> implements Container<T> {
    
            private T value;
            
            @Override
            public T getValue() {
                return value;
            }

            @Override
            public void setValue(T value) {
                this.value = value;
            }
        }
    Here NumberContainer implements an interface for container, now if we try to create a NumberContainer<String> this will throw a compile time exception.
    Same boundation can be done on class level
        interface Printable{}
        class MyNumber extends Number implements Printable{}
        class Boxx<T extends Number & Printable>{}

        Boxx can have only those class object as T, which extends Number and implements Printable, which is MyNumber in this case.
            MyNumber myNumber = new MyNumber(10);
            Boxx<MyNumber> boxx = new Boxx<MyNumber>();

# Generic constructors
    Here the class is not generic but the constructor is, we can pass value of any type, the syntax is to use the type <T> syntax before the constructor name to tell that the type of parameter will be generic, and then use it inside parameters, 
        public class Box2 {
        
            public <T> Box2(T value){
                System.out.println(value);
            }
            
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Box2 box = new Box2(1);
                Box2 box2 = new Box2("string");
            } 
        }

# Generic methods 
    Methods can also be made generic like this:
        use type <T> before the return type of the method.
        public class Test {

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
                String[] strings = {"hello","world"};
                printArray(strings);
            }

            public static <T> void printArray(T[] array){
                for(T element: array){
                    System.out.println(element);
                }
            }
        }

# Wild cards in generics
    In generics, a wildcard is represented by the question mark ?. It is used to specify unknown types when defining or using generic classes, interfaces, or methods.
    Suppose we write a generic method to print array, with return type as void
        public <T> void printArray(ArrayList<T> list){
            for(T t: list){
                System.out.println(t);
            }
        }
    So here we need not to use type T, we can use ? wild card as a method parameter, this will work the same.
        public void printArray(ArrayList<?> list){
            for(Object t: list){
                System.out.println(t);
            }
        }
    But in case we need to return something then we have to use genric type only, returning Object class type will again cause run time error.

    Types of Wildcards
        Unbounded Wildcard: <?>
            Accepts any type.
            Typically used when the logic doesn't depend on the type parameter.
                public void printList(List<?> list) {
                    for (Object obj : list) {
                        System.out.println(obj);
                    }
                }

        Upper Bounded Wildcard: <? extends T>
            Accepts T or any subclass of T.
            You can safely return values only when you're using upper-bounded wildcards (<? extends T>), because the compiler knows everything is at least of type T, Number class in this case.
                public double sum(List<? extends Number> numbers) {
                    double total = 0;
                    for (Number n : numbers) {
                        total += n.doubleValue();
                    }
                    return total;
                }
        
        Lower Bounded Wildcard: <? super T>
            Accepts T or any superclass of T.
            Used when you want to write to a generic structure.
                public void addIntegers(List<? super Integer> list) {
                    list.add(1);
                    list.add(2);
                }
    Note: 
        You cannot use ? as a return type, that‚Äôs not allowed by the compiler because ? is a wildcard, not a real type that you can work with. It‚Äôs only allowed in type arguments, not as a standalone return type.
        What you can do is use a bounded wildcard inside a generic wrapper
            public List<? extends Number> getNumbers() {
                return List.of(1, 2, 3);
            }

    Why this gives a compile time error, when we saw that we can use a wild card in generic wrapper.
        List<? extends Number> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3);
        Number n = numbers.get(0); // ‚úÖ You can read safely
        numbers.add(1);            // ‚ùå You can't add ‚Äî type is unknown
    Because you're using ? extends Number, which is an upper-bounded wildcard. That tells the compiler:
    "This list holds some subtype of Number ‚Äî could be Integer, Double, Long, etc. I don‚Äôt know which."
    And since the compiler doesn‚Äôt know the exact type, it can‚Äôt allow you to add anything to the list ‚Äî even if it seems safe like 1 (an Integer).

    What‚Äôs the fix?
    If you want to add values to a generic list, you need a lower-bounded wildcard:
        List<? super Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(1);  // ‚úÖ Allowed ‚Äî Integer or subclass
        numbers.add("sde");

    Why does "sde" fail?
        You declared the list as List<? super Integer>, which means:
        "This list can hold Integer or any superclass of Integer (like Number, Object)."
        BUT...
        The compiler still needs to ensure type safety, and it only allows you to add things that are guaranteed to be at least an Integer, not even float.
        1 is an Integer ‚úÖ
        1.0 is an Float ‚ùå
        "sde" is a String ‚ùå ‚Äî not allowed because it could violate the list‚Äôs type guarantee

# super vs extends in generics
    Understanding super vs extends in Java generics is key to using collections safely and effectively. Here's a clear breakdown:
        ? extends T ‚Äî Upper Bounded Wildcard, this is ‚ÄúProducer‚Äù ‚Äî You can read from it.
            Declaration:
                List<? extends Number> list;
                Means:
                "This list holds some unknown subtype of Number ‚Äî could be Integer, Double, etc."

                ‚úÖ You can:
                    Read items safely as Number
                    Example:
                        Number num = list.get(0); // Safe

                ‚ùå You cannot:
                    Add any type of object (not even Number)
                    Example:
                        list.add(123); // Compile error
                    Why? Because the actual type might be List<Double> ‚Äî adding an Integer would break type safety.

        ? super T ‚Äî Lower Bounded Wildcard, this is a ‚ÄúConsumer‚Äù ‚Äî You can write to it.
            Declaration:
                List<? super Integer> list;
                Means:
                "This list holds some unknown supertype of Integer ‚Äî could be Integer, Number, or Object."

                ‚úÖ You can:
                    Add Integer or its subtypes
                        Example:
                            list.add(123); // Safe
                    
                ‚ùå You cannot:
                    Safely read elements as an Integer
                        Example:
                            Integer i = list.get(0); // Compile error
                            Object o = list.get(0);  // OK
                    Why? Because the actual type might be Object, and Java won‚Äôt let you assume it's an Integer.

    Type erasure in Java is the process by which generic type information is removed at compile time, making generics a compile-time only feature. At runtime, the JVM has no knowledge of generic type parameters.

    üîç Why Does Type Erasure Exist?
    Java generics were added in Java 5, but to maintain backward compatibility with older Java code, the compiler erases generic types before compiling the bytecode. This means generic code can run on JVMs that predate generics.

    ‚úÖ What It Looks Like
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        String s = list.get(0);

    At runtime, this is equivalent to:
        List list = new ArrayList();  // raw type
        list.add("Hello");
        String s = (String) list.get(0);  // type cast added by compiler

    üßπ How Type Erasure Works:
        Generic types are replaced with their bounds (or Object if no bounds).
        Type casts are inserted to preserve type safety.
        Bridge methods are generated when needed (for inheritance with generics).
    Examples
        1. Erased type
            public class Box<T> {
                public T value;
            }
        Becomes:
            public class Box {
                public Object value;
            }

        2. Bounded type
            public class Box<T extends Number> {
                T value;
            }
        Becomes:
            public class Box {
                Number value;
            }

# what is instanceof and why can't we use it in generics
    instanceof is a Java operator used to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements an interface, at runtime.

    ‚úÖ Basic Usage
        if (obj instanceof String) {
            System.out.println("It's a String!");
        }
    This returns true if obj is a String, otherwise false.

    üß± Why instanceof Doesn‚Äôt Work with Generics
        Because of type erasure, the generic type information is removed at runtime. So something like this is not allowed:
        if (obj instanceof List<String>) {  // ‚ùå Compile-time error
            ...
        }
    This fails because at runtime, List<String> becomes just List. There's no way for the JVM to distinguish between List<String> and List<Integer>.

    Workaround: Use Class Tokens
        public <T> boolean isInstanceOf(Object obj, Class<T> clazz) {
            return clazz.isInstance(obj);
        }
    You can call:   
        isInstanceOf("hello", String.class);  // true
    This allows generic-like type checking while keeping it runtime-safe.

# why can't i create a generic array
    You can‚Äôt directly create a generic array in Java because of type erasure ‚Äî the compiler removes the generic type information at runtime, so the JVM doesn't actually know what type the array should hold. This leads to type safety issues.

     Why It's Disallowed
        Let's say you try this:
            T[] arr = new T[10]; // ‚ùå Compile-time error
        At runtime, due to type erasure, the JVM doesn‚Äôt know what T is ‚Äî it just sees Object[]. But generic arrays are meant to enforce type safety, and this would break that contract.
