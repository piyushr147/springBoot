# what is stream?

# Intermediate opereations

# Terminal operations

# why can't we reuse a stream after terminal operation?

# why intermediate operations are lazy
    1. Performance Optimization
        Laziness allows the stream to process only what is necessary. For example:

        Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
            .filter(n -> n > 2)
            .limit(1)
            .forEach(System.out::println);  // Only 1 element is filtered and printed
        Without laziness, all elements would be filtered even though we only need the first match.

    2. Chained Execution Planning
        Intermediate operations donâ€™t trigger any data processing. They just define steps in a pipeline:
        .filter()
        .map()
        .sorted()
        Only when a terminal operation like .collect() or .forEach() is called, the stream engine evaluates the entire chain in a single pass (fused).

    3. Avoid Unnecessary Work
        Since intermediate ops are lazy, they may never run if the terminal operation doesn't require them:

        Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3)
            .filter(n -> {
                System.out.println("Filter: " + n);
                return n > 1;
            });

        // Nothing printed here
        stream.count();  // Now "Filter: 1", "Filter: 2", etc. will print

    4. Supports Infinite Streams
        Laziness makes it possible to work with infinite streams:

        Stream.iterate(0, n -> n + 1)
            .limit(5)
            .forEach(System.out::println);
        Without laziness, infinite streams would lead to infinite computation!
